The USB Bit Whacker is a spectacular little development board featuring the PIC18F2553.
 Based on the work of Brian Schmalz, the UBW is a small board with a command interpreter for basic input and output control. 
 When attached to a Windows/Max OS X/Linux computer, the UBW will show up as an RS232 Com port! 
You control the individual I/O pins on the PIC through simple serial commands.
